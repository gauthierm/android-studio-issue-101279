# android-studio-issue-101279

https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=101279

This Android Studio project replciates the reported issue. The project is not set up to compile
anything meaningful and probably doesn't compile. It's intended to trigger the code inspection
error with no other extra stuff.

To test, check out the project, open it in Android Studio and run `Analyze -> Inspect Code ...`.

Android Studio will report "No suspicious code found.". Exceptions can be viewed
with `Help -> View Logs in Finder`
